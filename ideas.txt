This is a test

Your ideas for the Track Tagger app provide a great foundation for brainstorming design layouts. Let's break down each feature and think about how they could be represented in the user interface.

Browsing Songs on Spotify:

Consider a search bar prominently placed on the home page or in a persistent navigation bar for easy access.
Display search results in a grid or list format, showing song titles, artists, and album covers.
Include a play button or a preview option for each song.
Adding Tags to Songs:

Next to each song in the search results or in a dedicated song view, provide an option to add tags.
Use a text input field or a tag editor where users can type in their tags. Consider autocomplete suggestions based on existing tags.
Display current tags associated with the song, if any.
Creating and Deleting Tags:

Implement a tag management section where users can add new tags or delete existing ones.
Provide a simple list of tags with 'edit' and 'delete' options next to each tag.
Consider a confirmation prompt for deleting tags to prevent accidental deletion.
Viewing Tags and Associated Songs:

Create a separate view or page for users to see all their tags.
When a user selects a tag, display all the songs linked to that tag in a list or grid format.
This view could also allow users to edit or delete tags.
Building Playlists from Tags:

In the tag view, add an option to create a new playlist from all songs under a tag.
Alternatively, allow users to select specific songs from a tag to add to an existing or new playlist.
Display an easy-to-use interface for playlist management, where users can name playlists and see the songs they've added.
Wireframe Ideas:
Homepage:

A clean and minimalistic design with a large search bar in the center or at the top.
Navigation menu to access tag management, playlist creation, and user profile.
Search Results Page:

Songs displayed in a responsive grid or list with essential details.
Hover-over or click-to-expand options for adding tags and playing previews.
Tag Management Interface:

A straightforward list of tags with edit and delete options.
An 'add new tag' button or field at the top.
Tag-Specific Song View:

Similar layout to the search results, but filtered by the selected tag.
Options to edit the tag or bulk add songs to playlists.
Playlist Building Interface:

A drag-and-drop interface or checkboxes for selecting songs from a tag to add to playlists.
An overview of the current playlist with editing options.
These are just initial ideas to get you started. The actual design may evolve as you consider user experience, aesthetics, and functionality. Remember, user feedback is crucial, so consider creating prototypes and conducting usability tests to refine your design.
